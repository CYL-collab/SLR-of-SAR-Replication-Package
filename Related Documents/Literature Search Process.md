## Literature Search Process

### Conducting Initial Search

We conducted the initial search on Nov 2025. It was performed using the Boolean query: `(software aging*) OR (software ageing*) OR (aging-related bug*) OR (software rejuvenation)` in the field of title, abstract, and keywords of publications. Non-research publications were preliminarily excluded using database-specific filters as belows:
